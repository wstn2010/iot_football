Welcome to the iot_football wiki!

Football is loved by people in the world.
I expect that if a ball has other functionality itself, it enhances football enjoyment.
Here, I call it IOTball.

[how to]
* Embeds device board into a ball
* Measures moves of the ball using Accelerometer/Magnetometer on the board
    * Later, calculates a rotation, impact intensity, an orbit from gathered data
* Fix device board in the ball
    * like this => ![](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3352587/how_to_fix.jpg)
* Measured data are transmitted to mobile device/computer via SDHC wifi card in realtime

[applications]
* night-football: lighted using LED. reflect judgements on the ball, such as throwing, yellow-card, left-time
* solo-play: practice of free-kick, analyze my kick (*1)
* training: measures fundamental technique (*1)
* virtual replay: replay measured data with 3D animation (*1)
* kick informatics: link data to videography using OpenCV => display any analysis on a movie, optimize parameters for interpreting sensor data  

(*1) orz... we have already be able to play with => http://micoach.adidas.com/jp/smartball/ amazing!

[memo]
* Entry page: http://armcontest.elektor.com <= my proposal has been accepted.
* I use [FRDM-K64F](http://www.freescale.com/webapp/sps/site/prod_summary.jsp?code=FRDM-K64F)
* a location of opencv lib: /usr/local/Cellar/opencv/2.4.10.1/lib/
